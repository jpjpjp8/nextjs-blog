My name is Jose Paulo E. Mendoza, I live in San Agustin, CIty of San Fernando, Pampanga. My hobbies are spending time with my family and friends. 
I took up Computer ENgineering because I want to learn about the hardware and software of a computer.
I see myself five years from now as a Computer Engineer working in a well known company.
I expect to  learn about the process of making software.
The topics that I want to be tackled in the subject is the basics first, I would like to master it first so that It would not be difficult when moving to other topics.
